# Space_knowlegde_graph_builder


Developed a framework for assessing the quality of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) extracted from OIE algorithms by introducing custom metrics based on triplet extraction, entity recognition, and completeness. Proposed a distance-based mathematical model to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy and structural soundness of extracted graphs against ideal graphs. Analyzed the performance of StanfordIE, ClausIE, and OpenIE6 models, identifying key strengths and limitations through comprehensive metric-driven comparisons.
